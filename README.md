# MadhuCalculatorProject

Weâ€™re aiming for the following goals for this project:
1. A working Calculator: The main task is to create a Calculator not only will this test your 
understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem. 
2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible 
using git, GitHub and the command line.
3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning 
on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, 
BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad


1. Calculator Takes DMAS Rule
2. enter all the operands and operators, the final expression is calculated by hitting the "=" symbol
3. For calculation reduce and map functions are used
